In this repo I'll upload all the practices, homeworks, problems, and projects I've done to complete online courses. 

This is just an index to all those courses, with information about them, and the proper links if you want to know more about them, or even better, enroll!

The order of the courses is attempted to be from more relevant to less relevant.
