## MOOCs

MOOC is just the *fancy* word to online course (Massive Open Online Course). 

In this repo I'll upload all the practices, homeworks, problems, and projects I've done so far to complete them. 

All the courses in this repo -*and, actually, all the courses I've been enrolled*- are free -*unless you decide to pay for a certificate*-.

This README is just to briefly explain what's this repo about. 

Inside each category -*folder*- is a more detailed index of all those courses, with information about them, and the proper links if you want to know more about them, or even better, enroll!

The order of the courses is **attempted** to be from more relevant to less relevant. You may agree with the order or not. 

### **NOTE**

**I think it's pretty obvious, but if not, know this: This repository contains *'sensitive'* content about the courses. If you are currently enrolled in one of them, please avoid peeking at my solutions.**
